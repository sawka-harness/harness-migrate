#!/bin/sh
# Builds and publishes a release for the migrate plugin, independent of this
# repo's own .drone.yml release of the standalone kingpin binary. Triggered off
# tags matching migrate/vX.Y.Z — a prefixed series, so it never collides with
# the standalone binary's bare v* tags and never becomes GitHub's "latest".
#
# Lives under plugin/ alongside everything else the plugin owns: it builds only
# the plugin module and shares nothing with the root Makefile/.drone.yml build.
#
# Usage:
#   plugin/scripts/release-migrate.sh <tag> [--publish]
#
# <tag> must be exactly migrate/vX.Y.Z. Artifacts are always built into
# plugin/dist/ so they can be inspected. Publishing is opt-in: without --publish
# the script stops after building, so a bare/mistyped invocation can never
# create a GitHub release. --publish creates the release as a draft — core's
# install/resolve code already ignores drafts — so a human still reviews and
# publishes it from GitHub.
#
# --publish also requires HEAD to actually be the given tag, with no local
# changes on top of it — so the released binaries always match the tagged
# commit, whether run from CI or a workstation.
#
# The artifact names here are core's plugin-release convention, not ours to
# choose: `harness install plugin` looks for
# harness-plugin-migrate_<ver>_<os>_<arch>.{tar.gz,zip} plus checksums.txt in a
# release tagged migrate/vX.Y.Z, and gates the binary inside on being named
# harness-migrate. Change any of these and installs stop resolving.
